# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection using various Sampling techniques.
Performing 5 different sampling techniques on a dataset.
### Dataset used
Creditcard_data.csv
### Execution steps
- Visualising the outcome class 'Class' by using countplot.
- Balancing using oversampling as the Class 1 was a minority class and very less compared to class 0.
- Applying 5 different sampling methods on the new dataset.
  - Simple Random Sampling
  - Systematic Sampling
  - Stratified Sampling
  - Cluster Sampling
  - Bootstrap sampling
- Training and testing each sample with 5 different models.
  -  Logistic Regression
  - KNN
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - SVC
### Results
- Making an accuracy table with each cell corresponding to the accuracy score of the respective model with the respective sample.
### Observations
- Random forest turned out to be the best model with an average accuracy of 0.990881.
